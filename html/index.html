    <p>I am a little biased towards the Saab 9-3 as I do own one. Saab ever since world war 2
      has made the world's safest car the Saab 9-3. It was Sweden's iconic sedan/coupe/convertible. 
      While it had more of a luxurious daily driver status Saab did release several "performance"
      variants of the 9-3 which held their own against Europe's extremely powerful german sports cars.

      <!--paragraph with summary of changes to the saab 9-3 over its production-->
      <p>The Saab 900/9-3 had a very impressive boost in power over its lifespan. Increasing
        in 120hp since 1984! The Saab 9-3 also took a very interesting turn over its Production
        years going from being a dedicated front-wheel drive (FWD) turbo 4-cylinder car to being
        an all-wheel drive (AWD) turbo 6-cylinder around the mid-2000s. This is very uncommon for
        sports cars as they tend to stick to a very specific drive train with Saab originally
        being FWD only. Their sports variants were very limited and loved which makes them
        excellent sports cars today.

      <br>
      <!--Paragraph with a link to a wiki page for the 9-3-->
      <p>Overall the Saab 900/9-3 had a very impressive run with their sports variants. Sadly
        Saab as a company no longer exists but their cars are still collected and known around
        the world. More on their history can be found 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_9-3">here</a>.

        <br>
        <p>The m3 has always been the golden standard of a sports car in Europe. BMW made
          this car not only handle extremely well with its perfectly engineered 50:50 weight
          distributed chassis but they also made it fast. Every year BMW sought to increase the 
          power on this car's 6 cylinder engine. BMW even introduced for a limited time in 2007
          a V8 model of the m3 which was regarded as one of the best V8s ever made by many 
          automotive journalists.

          <p>The BMW m3 made a very impressive power increase throughout its lifespan. Going from 238hp to
            480hp this car every year offered a huge power increase (disregarding the F80). In 2014 BMW
            opted for a twin-turbo 6 cylinder to keep power above 400hp and still maintain a lighter
            6-cylinder engine. The older BMWs are some of the most sought-after cars in the automotive
            world and their newer cars are always certified classics. More history of BMW's M3 models
            can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M3">here</a>.

            <p>The GTI in the 80s was the pioneer of being a people's sports car.
              Before the GTI if you wanted a performance car you either bought a supercar or you
              bought a 2 door coupe with a massive engine. But Volkswagen created this "hot hatch"
              to be a light and affordable option for someone who wants a sports car. Throughout the years 
              the GTI was never known for its amazing performance but more for its iconic styling and feel.

              <p>The GTI is still being made today with its first models being introduced almost 
                50 years ago. While its horsepower numbers aren't very high they still make excellent
                daily drivable sports cars that won't break the bank. GTIs have always kept a clean
                FWD hatchback design that keeps on being improved. While they aren't particularly rare 
                some collectors will pay high prices for earlier models and some even end up in 
                automotive museums.
